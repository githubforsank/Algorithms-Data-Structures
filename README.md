# Algorithms-Data-Structures
Algorithm plays a vital role in our day to day life. May be we started to learn the process of doing something that was useful to us since our childhood. Since that day we learnt algorithms. 
At this part of time we essentially require to code the computer system to do jobs for us, evaluate complex mathematical operations, perform graphical analysis and processing and many more. 
This repo contains the basic coded structures of the most essentially needed algorithms.
